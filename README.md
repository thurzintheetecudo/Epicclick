Some games have an really boring OST while you're fighting. So this app plays some song in the playlist (all local) when it reaches certain CPS you determined.

Aight so, one day i got bored and decided to try this thing i had in my mind. My Code ability is really low so eh, this is what comes out when you use Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. Tbh, i made it all for myself so i didn't thought a lot about NOT using AI but rn i feel kinda embarassed. If you want to improve my idea, go ahead.
